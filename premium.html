<div id="home">
  <h1>Premium</h1>
  
  <p>The main part of the application is (and will ever be) freely available. The source code is open source and can be viewed and edited on Github.</p>
  
  <p>However, there is a Premium version available, which currently adds two features:
    <ul>
    <li>Remove all advertisements.</li>
    <li>Add the ability to configure more than one connection</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>The Premium version can be obtained from within the application. On the top right side, there is a context menu including a button for the Premium version. Billing is handled by Google. There is currently no chance to bypass the billing service and buy the version using i.e. Paypal or other services.</p>
  
  <p>If not wanting to provide credit card information to google, the easiest approach is probably to buy a Gift Card for Google Play (<a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/intl/en-US_us/about/giftcards/">US</a> / <a target="_blank" href="http://play.google.com/intl/de_de/about/giftcards/">DE</a>).
