  <h1>External Interfaces</h1>
  
  <h2>Llama / Tasker / Locale</h2>
  
  <p>Apps like the ones mentioned above allow to execute actions based on external events. Those events may well be the connection to a WLAN, the entering of some area. Those events are pretty useful if combined with an FHEM instance. This is why andFHEM provides an external interface to those apps.</p>
  
  <h3>UI based</h3>
  
  <p>Since version 2.1.4 andFHEM provides a UI for sending commands to FHEM. Just look for an andFHEM plugin in your favourite location aware switching app.</p>

  <p>You can also trigger actions based on device states. However, this works only in Locale and Tasker.</p>
  
  
  <h3>Manual Switching</h3>
  
  In Llama, you have the option to send own android intents as event. Here are the details you need to enter to send actual commands to FHEM:
  
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Preset</td><td>Own Android Intent</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Intent-Send-Mode</td><td>Start Service (Activity or Broadcast will NOT work!)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Package Name</td><td>li.klass.fhem</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Class Name</td><td>li.klass.fhem.service.intent.SendCommandIntentService</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Event</td><td>li.klass.fhem.constants.Actions.EXECUTE_COMMAND</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Under 'Extras' specify a new key value pair containing</td>
        <td>Key: COMMAND<br>
        Datatype: string<br>
        Value: &lt;ENTER YOUR COMMAND HERE&gt; (i.e. set abc on)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
